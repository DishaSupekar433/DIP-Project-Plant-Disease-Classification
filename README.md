The detection and classification of plant diseases play a crucial role in ensuring agricultural sustainability and maximizing crop yield and quality. 
In this study, we propose a deep learning-based approach utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for automatic classification of potato plant leaves affected by various diseases. 
The dataset, sourced from the "PlantVillage" dataset, comprises 2152 images categorized into three classes: Healthy Leaves, Early Blight, and Late Blight. 
The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets, with appropriate data augmentation and preprocessing techniques applied. 
The CNN model architecture is defined using the Keras Sequential API, consisting of convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers. 
TensorFlow and Keras are utilized for model development, Python programming language for implementation, and Jupyter Notebook for experimentation. 
The model achieves an impressive accuracy of 99.8% on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in disease classification. 
The project's results highlight the potential of deep learning techniques in improving agricultural practices by enabling early detection and intervention in plant diseases. 
Future research directions include exploring alternative technologies, enhancing model robustness, and integrating the system into real-world agricultural workflows.
